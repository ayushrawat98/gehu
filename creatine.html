    <h1> CREATINE</h1>
    <p style="font-size:20px">Creatine is an organic compound with the nominal formula (H2N)(HN)CN(CH3)CH2CO2H. This
        species exists in various modifications (tautomers) in solution. Creatine is found in vertebrates where it
        facilitates recycling of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell, primarily in muscle and
        brain tissue. Recycling is achieved by converting adenosine diphosphate (ADP) back to ATP via donation of
        phosphate groups. Creatine also acts as a buffer</p>
